# 🛒 GA4 E-commerce Analytics using SQL

## 📌 Project Overview

This project leverages the **Google Analytics 4 (GA4) Sample E-commerce Dataset** (available in BigQuery) to analyze user behavior, purchase patterns, and business performance using **SQL queries**.

The analysis covers **conversion funnels, user engagement, product popularity, cross-sell behavior, and revenue metrics**, with actionable insights that can help e-commerce businesses improve **customer acquisition, retention, and monetization strategies**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Extract key **e-commerce KPIs** using SQL
* Understand **user journeys** across funnel stages
* Identify **top-performing products and cross-sell opportunities**
* Measure **customer engagement and retention patterns**
* Highlight **revenue distribution and premium buyer behavior**

## 📂 Dataset

* **Source:** `bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*`
* **Type:** Google Analytics 4 sample e-commerce event-level data
* **Period Covered:** 92 days (\~3 months)
* **Key Attributes:**

  * `event_name` (pageviews, add\_to\_cart, checkout, purchase, etc.)
  * `user_pseudo_id` (unique user identifier)
  * `event_params` (session\_id, purchase value, item details, etc.)
  * `items` (product details: name, ID, quantity, price)

## 📈 Key Business Takeaways

* **Conversion Weak Point:** Most users drop after viewing items (optimize product pages, CTA design).
* **Retention Gap:** Very high new user % but low repeat buying. Focus on **loyalty & re-engagement**.
* **Product Demand:** Apparel drives volume, but premium buyers drive revenue.
* **Cross-Sell Potential:** Bundling products like T-shirts + accessories could increase basket size.
* **Revenue Concentration:** Small group of high-value customers account for significant revenue.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **SQL** (Google BigQuery)
* **Dataset:** GA4 E-commerce Sample Data
* **Tools:** Google Cloud Platform, BigQuery Console
